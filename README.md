# Image Registration and Data Collection

This is a collection of scripts to run ImageJ turboreg on a stack of .png files of neurons.

Required Software:

[MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)

[ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html)

[MIJ (MATLAB-ImageJ Plugin)](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/soft/mij/) <-- This will need to be initialized using the javaaddpath command, as detailed on their site.
It is already initialized in the script, so this only applies to those attempting to use it without the script.
