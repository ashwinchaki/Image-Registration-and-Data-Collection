# ImageJ Required Plugins and Macros

These are slightly modified versions of [TurboReg](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/turboreg/) and [StackReg](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/stackreg/), as well as a macro for using StackReg.

To install, copy both the plugins and macros folders into the ImageJ root directory.
